# Security Policy

## Scope
This repository is an educational security lab and intentionally contains vulnerable smart contracts.
Findings reported on **vulnerable modules** may be expected by design.

## Reporting
If you find an issue that affects:
- the **safe implementations**, or
- the **tooling/CI**, or
- the **tests** in a way that breaks the intended learning outcomes,

please open a GitHub Issue with:
- a short description
- affected file(s)
- steps to reproduce
- expected vs actual behavior

## Notes
- Do not deploy vulnerable contracts to mainnet or production systems.
- Use this repo strictly for learning and testing.
